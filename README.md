# Smart-Mini-Power-Grid-Optimisation-Forcasting
End-to-end simulation and optimisation of a smart power grid, applying data structures, linear programming, mathematical modelling, physics (energy systems), and machine learning to forecast demand. Built in Python using real-world inspired data from South Australia.

Project Overview
This project simulates a miniature smart power grid consisting of generators, consumers, and transmission lines. It applies linear programming to optimize energy dispatch, models transmission losses based on real physics concepts, and uses machine learning to forecast demand patterns. The project is inspired by real-world power grid operations with example data based on South Australia's energy system. Technologies used include Python, NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
