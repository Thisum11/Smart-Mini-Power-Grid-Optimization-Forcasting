Generator Class Design

# Purpose of Generator Class
- Represents each generator in the grid simulation

# Main attributes
- name (String): Name of the generator (Ex: Boliver, Broken Hill)
- max_capacity (MW) : The maximum amount of power that can be output by a generator
- min_capacity (MW) : The minimum amount of power that can be output by a generator (optional)
- cost_per_MWh ($) : The cost of generating power for an hour
- source_type (String) : The energy type (Ex: wind, solar, gas)
- is_renewable (boolean) : Whether the energy is renewable or not (Ex: true, false)
- current_output  (MW) : The amount of energy currently generated by the generator
