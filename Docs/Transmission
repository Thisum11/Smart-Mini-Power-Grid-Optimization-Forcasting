Transmission Class Design

#Purpose of Transmission Class
To model the connection between two nodes

# Main attributes
- transmission_id (str): The unique identifier of the transmission line
- start_node (Node) : the starting point
- end_node (Node) : the receiving point of the line
- capacity (MW) -> float : the max power that can be carried in the line
- resistance (ohms) -> float: electrical resistance on the line
- length (km) -> float: length of the transmission line
- current_flow (MW) -> float: current transmitting amount of power
- loss (MW) -> float: the amount of losses power during the transmission
- k_voltage (kV) -> float: 330 the standard transmission voltage in south australian power grid

# Main methods
.loss_calculation(power:float) --> returns the losses power during the transmission
        voltage = k_voltage / 2
        loss = ((power)^2 x resistance)/(voltage)^2
.transmission_status () --> if the power < capacity : true
.update_transmission () --> resets power & loss according to the new power
.get_transmission () --> displays the transmitting start point & end point
.efficiency () --> the amount of energy received as a percentage of the amount given at the start
        efficiency = (power - loss)X100/power
.__str__() --> display the class attributes
